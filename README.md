## A Word-Level Uncertainty Estimation Approach for Black-Box TextClassifiers using RNNs

This repository provides the implementation of the paper "A Word-Level Uncertainty Estimation Approach for Black-Box TextClassifiers using RNNs"

# Note

- The Keras model (rnn_v0.h5) has to be unzipped bevor running the experiments. 
- The Google word2vec corpus is required to train a model: https://github.com/mmihaltz/word2vec-GoogleNews-vectors
